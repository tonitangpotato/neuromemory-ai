# Commercial License

Engram is dual-licensed:

## Open Source — AGPL-3.0

The default license is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (AGPL-3.0). You are free to use, modify, and distribute engram under the terms of the AGPL-3.0, which requires that:

- Any modified version you distribute must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0
- If you run a modified version as a network service, you must make the source code available to users of that service

## Commercial License

If the AGPL-3.0 terms don't work for your use case — for example:

- You want to use engram in **proprietary/closed-source software**
- You want to offer engram as part of a **commercial SaaS product** without open-sourcing your code
- You need **patent protection** or **warranty/indemnification**
- Your organization's legal policy **prohibits AGPL dependencies**

A commercial license is available. Contact us:

Commercial licenses include:
- Permission to use engram in closed-source products
- No copyleft obligations
- Priority support
- Custom terms available for enterprise

*This dual-license model ensures engram stays open and community-driven while also being viable for commercial use.*
